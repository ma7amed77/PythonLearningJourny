#### Hello, I am Mohamed Moataz a data science student at Alexandria University.
#### Here I am sharing projects of me learning Python to master it.

## P2 Mini DataFram
A simple pandas like dataframe.
Still has a lot to improve, like making DataFrame a class and make functions inside it, instead of being inside the main app. But this is for getting the hang of python data structures.

## P1 Simple Text Editor.
In this projects I am practicing stacks and error handling.
It's a simple terminal text editor with save and load and simple history, nothing fancy.
