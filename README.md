Hello, I am Mohamed Moataz a data science student at Alexandria University.
Here I am sharing projects of me learning Python to master it.

P1 Simple Text Editor
In this projects I am practicing stacks and error handling.
It's a simple terminal text editor with save and load and simple history, nothing fancy.
